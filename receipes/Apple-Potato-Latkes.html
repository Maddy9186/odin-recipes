        <h2>Apple-Potato Latkes Receipe</h2>
        <p>A nontraditional approach to a potato latke. 
            The shredding is done using a spiralizer, 
            and the apple and maple syrup give you just enough sweetness 
            to make these different. Good topped with sour cream or 
            applesauce. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 russet potato, peeled</li>
            <li>1 firm apple, peeled</li>
            <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1
            Make a deep vertical cut on each side of the potato and apple.</li>
            
            <li>Step 2
            
            Attach potato to a spiralizer fitted with the small shredded blade and cut into thin shreds. Repeat with apple. Spread shredded potato and apple on several layers of paper towels; squeeze to release as much moisture as possible. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Step 3
            
            Mix egg, flour, maple syrup, salt, and nutmeg into the bowl.</li>
            <li>Step 4
            
            Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture into the skillet; flatten slightly with a spatula. Cook until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with remaining mixture, adding more oil if needed.</li>
